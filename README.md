## Tarkov Tracker v2 Update
The bot has been completely rewritten to utilize Discord's slash commands features and to comply with Discord's decision to make message content an intent. You may need to update the bot's permissions with the [invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=864333416191229973&permissions=248896&scope=applications.commands%20bot).

Read more about Discord's decision [here](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404772028055-Message-Content-Access-Deprecation-for-Verified-Bots). 

- Some files dealing with the database are not available because I'm working on an API for the kill data
